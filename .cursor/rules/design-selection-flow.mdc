# Design Selection Flow

The design selection tool operates with the following workflow:

1. Tool is initialized in [src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts)
2. When executed, the tool:
   - Generates HTML from templates in [src/tools/templates/designSelection.ts](mdc:src/tools/templates/designSelection.ts)
   - Starts a local HTTP server using [src/tools/utils/serverUtils.ts](mdc:src/tools/utils/serverUtils.ts)
   - Opens a browser window for user interaction
   - Waits for user selection via polling mechanism
   - Returns the selected design and shuts down the server

## Key Functions

- `serveHtmlOnLocalhost()`: Creates temporary HTML file and serves it
- `generateDesignSelectionHTML()`: Creates the UI for comparing designs
- `getSelectedDesign()`: Retrieves the user's selection
- `stopLocalServer()`: Gracefully shuts down the local server

## Data Flow

1. Design HTML content is passed to the tool
2. Server renders options in the browser
3. User selects a design, which is sent back via HTTP POST
4. Selection is stored in server-side state
5. Tool returns the selected design info as its response
