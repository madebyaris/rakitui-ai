# Server Implementation Details

The design selection tool uses a local HTTP server to display design options and handle user selection. This is implemented in [src/tools/utils/serverUtils.ts](mdc:src/tools/utils/serverUtils.ts).

## Server Features

- Creates a temporary directory for HTML files if needed
- Finds an available port starting from 3000
- Serves the design selection HTML page at `/design-selection`
- Accepts design selection via POST to `/design-selection-result`
- Provides selection status via `/design-selection-finalized`
- Implements CORS for browser compatibility
- Handles graceful server shutdown

## Important Implementation Notes

- The server maintains state using variables like `selectedDesign` and `selectionComplete`
- Port finding logic increments until an available port is found
- Server has a 15-minute timeout for user selection
- The browser polls the server to know when to close itself
- Temporary files are created with timestamped names for uniqueness
