# Development Guide

This guide covers the development workflow for the Rakit UI AI project.

## Project Setup

- [package.json](mdc:package.json) defines the project dependencies and scripts
- TypeScript configuration is in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- The project uses ES modules (type: "module" in package.json)

## Build & Run

- `npm run build`: Cleans dist directory, compiles TypeScript, and builds MCP
- `npm run watch`: Watches for changes during development
- `npm start`: Starts the MCP server from the compiled dist directory

## Key Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: Core MCP SDK
- `mcp-framework`: Framework for building MCP tools
- `open`: Library for opening URLs in the default browser

## Development Workflow

1. Create/modify tool implementations in `src/tools/`
2. Update templates as needed in `src/tools/templates/`
3. Run `npm run watch` for development
4. Test using `npm start`
5. Build for distribution with `npm run build`

## Note on Browser Integration

The server creates temporary files in a `tmp` directory at the project root. Make sure this directory has appropriate permissions for file creation.
